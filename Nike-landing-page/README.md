# React + Vite
In this Single Page Application. I have created a Landing Page of Nike shoes. 
It has two components one Navbar and another is Hero components.

This is the output: 
![Nike landing page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37b5db44-a160-4eb9-87e2-d1d290c1c914)




This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
